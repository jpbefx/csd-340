                    <p>To write about myself... This is a bit of a difficult topic for me to write about in a short essay. I am the oldest between my brother and myself. Been learning new and exciting things for twenty-eight years now, ( this is eleven years old now). Single parent of three amazing kids, they are my biggest inspiration in life. </p>
                    <p>Ever since I can remember I have wanted to be a part of the entertainment business; movies always fascinated me. My personality is always referred to as weird which I place blame on my birthday, (Halloween). As a child, I was mostly into horror movies. I was constantly trying to figure out how they made it look so real by experimenting with different things to re-create them with material I could find around the house. I have always been making things with my hands since I can remember. When we were children my brother and I were not allowed to have any toy weapons, as our mother never liked them. Naturally, I also wanted to be able to play cops and robbers with the other neighborhood children. So instead of being left out I found other means, like making paper guns. They were so elaborate, with batteries in the handle encased in separate pieces of paper so they would slide out like a magazine and lock back in. The barrels were made so they also slid back and forth imitating the action of an automatic pistol. One Christmas when I was around twelve. We had a new house, without a fireplace. I had always seen the fireplace on T.V. and felt I wanted that too. The stockings just don't look the same on the wall or back of the couch. So, I made a box frame with 2x4's and skinned it with cardboard boxes, painted bricks on it with marker and hung the stockings on the front. </p>
                    <p>During the Halloween season, it is a 'No Holds Barred' effects game. I always try to find a new theme to decorate my home. Zombies are fun to do with Elmer's glue and cereal. Most fun I had was in '06 when I was the director for a haunted house outside of Mills mall. Now my kids are my victims for Halloween. Last year I went to JoAnne Fabric and made costumes for them. My oldest was a zombie cop, second was a soldier, and third was a mummy. Really would like to save up enough money one of these years where I can do full costumes and prosthetics on all three of them,. But I will wait for them all to get a little older before I try to make head casts of them. </p>
                    <p>I am striving every day to learn new things and gain new experiences. With hard work and dedication, I plan to help create tomorrow's inspiring entertainment.</p>
